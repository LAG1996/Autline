# Autline

Welcome to the repository for Autline, formally called [Hero Letter](https://github.com/LAG1996/HeroLetter).

## What is it?

Autline is an AUTomatic outLINE tool meant to help authors plan out their creative pieces. The idea is to work with the spontaneity
involved in the writing process. From my experience in writing, it is very easy to make up entities in a story while defining a
separate entity. For example, say you're making up an event in your plot and then create a character involved in that event. You
may not have defined that character before. What if you forget to give that character definition because you'd rather focus on the story first?

Autline will automatically create a card for that character for you once you save your event.

## What's *in* it?

I'm using the Meteor package. In particular, I'm using

- JavaScript
- BlazeJS (Soon to be ReactJS)
- MongoDB
- HTML
- CSS ([Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/))

I'm also using some miscellaneous packages provided by Meteor to handle routing and such.

## Does it work?

*Autline* isn't in a working state just yet, as I'm still planning out its architecture. Right now, it's just a mock-up so that I can figure out what goes where.
However, you can check out the old [app](https://heroletter.herokuapp.com/views/story_editor.html#) to get an idea of its basic functionality. As usual with these solo prototypes, you can expect some bugs. It works *mostly* well :)
